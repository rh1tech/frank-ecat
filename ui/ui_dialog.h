 * Modal primitives, ported from pico-speccy src/ui/UiDialog.cpp.
 *
 * They draw with ui_gfx over whatever is on screen and never save what
 * was underneath -- the caller owns the repaint afterwards, exactly as
 * run_modal() in ui_nav.c already does for actions.
 *
 * Their file also carries an inline line editor, a pick list, a busy
 * box, a paused badge and a countdown confirm. Those came with features
 * this firmware does not have (renaming files over FTP, choosing a tape
 * block, a post-reboot video-mode revert), so they are not here yet.
