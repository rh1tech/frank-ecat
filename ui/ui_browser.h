 * with a scrollbar hairline, an info pane naming the focused file and
 * the verbs that apply to it, and a footer that becomes a Find prompt.
 *
 * What did not come across is the half of their file that is about
 * their storage rather than about browsing -- the on-card .idx cache
 * (SortedFiles.h), the per-type position memory, the ZIP and slot verbs,
 * the FTP and web-archive back ends. This board reads a directory with
 * storage_list() straight into an array and that is the whole model, so
 * their index machinery has nothing to index.
